# baumer_genicam.py
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Real image capture from the Baumer VCXU-23C camera via GenICam/GenTL,
# confirmed working end-to-end 2026-08-10 using the `harvesters` Python
# library against the camera's own bgapi2_usb.cti GenTL producer
# (installed with Baumer Camera Explorer).
#
# NOT the confocal (N-SPARC) detector - the Baumer VCXU-23C is a separate
# industrial color camera found already installed on the microscope PC
# (Baumer Camera Explorer + Toshiba Teli GenICam SDK). Originally added
# just to exercise the rest of the pipeline (focus_check, dashboard)
# against real frames while N-SPARC capture was blocked on NIS-Elements
# licensing/Jobs work (see docs/microscope-notes.md's "Image Capture"
# investigation for that history).
#
# 2026-08-17: now the PRIMARY capture path by deliberate decision - the
# team decided against capturing through NIS-Elements/Jobs at all (see
# mcp_server/loop_tools.py's header comment), so this module's capture()
# is what mcp_server.loop_tools.get_image() actually calls. Whatever is
# optically coupled to wherever this camera is physically mounted is
# what gets captured - that's a hardware/alignment decision made outside
# this code, not something this module controls.
#
# Requires `pip install harvesters opencv-python` (confirmed against
# harvesters==1.4.3, genicam==1.5.1; opencv-python added 2026-08-17,
# Bayer demosaicing only - see capture() below). A camera can only be
# held by one application at a time - close Baumer Camera Explorer (or
# any other GenICam consumer) before using this.
